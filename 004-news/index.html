    Today, Duster Lizzie is ecstatic to announce a new compilation, ‘Spiritual Sequel’, out on Chamber Tapes. Slated for a December 4th release, the compilation will be available across digital platforms for purchase and streaming.
    </br>
    </br>
    Invited to record at the Future Classic x Dropbox Studios in Los Angeles in 2018, Duster Lizzie set out to write new material in a more collaborative fashion. To do this, he brought in a handful of trusted musician friends and what resulted was a grab-bag of short loops which were later reworked as full-length tracks for Duster Lizzie’s new project, ‘Spiritual Sequel’. “In My Utopia” is one of several tracks that saw new life, initially consisting of a drum, bass, and synthesizer loop before adding in more synths, vocals, etc.
    </br>
    </br>
    “In My Utopia”, is a politically charged earworm driven by layered synthesizers and lush drums that juxtapose the track’s powerful flow. Inspired by the endless protesting across the country, the track is saturated with heavy lyrics detailing an ‘eye for an eye’ battle against America’s unjust police system, with uprising chants for lines such as: “For every tax I pay to let them kill, I take a life / In my utopia, equivalent exchange is peace of mind”. Duster Lizzie (the moniker of East Los Angeles’s own Eddie Hernandez) says about the track: “Utopia is not a permanent concept to me, it’s an impossible goal to reach, but in this case, I see it as a brief marker of relief. When Trump lost the election, there should have only been a split-second celebration over what really is a victory so small in volume, before continuing to work against social injustice. Everyone who still thinks the battle has been won is living in a privileged bubble. The world is fucked, police abolition is key.”

    The accompanying video is self-directed by Hernandez himself and is a deep-fried karaoke-like visualizer with lyrics speeding over the screen in massive bold type similar to a lightspeed bombardment of pop-up advertisements. “There’s no other way I wanted the video for this track to turn out. I just wanted to dance around in this remote location I’ve been quarantined at for several months whilst singing such politically charged lyrics. In the last few months, it’s been so special for me to participate in protests and see fellow protesters dance along to music on the scene, whether folks are blasting music from their speakers, or someone’s got a tambourine. They continue to dance and move and embrace their bodies, despite the weight that the world forces them to carry. That’s the energy I wanted to capture in this video. With lyrics as bold as those in ‘In My Utopia,’ it made sense to have them fly out at the screen and visually attack the viewer. It’s supposed to confront you; it’s supposed to make you snap out of it every morning and question to yourself, “what efforts have I made today to fight against those who keep getting away with killing innocent people?”
