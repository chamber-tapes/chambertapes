    <p>
    Today, Duster Lizzie is ecstatic to announce a new compilation, ‘Spiritual Sequel’, out on Chamber Tapes. Slated for a December 4th release, the compilation will be available across digital platforms for purchase and streaming.
    </br>
    </br>
    Invited to record at the Future Classic x Dropbox Studios in Los Angeles in 2018, Duster Lizzie set out to write new material in a more collaborative fashion. To do this, he brought in a handful of trusted musician friends and what resulted was a grab-bag of short loops which were later reworked as full-length tracks for Duster Lizzie’s new project, ‘Spiritual Sequel’. “In My Utopia” is one of several tracks that saw new life, initially consisting of a drum, bass, and synthesizer loop before adding in more synths, vocals, etc.
    </br>
    </br>
    “In My Utopia”, is a politically charged earworm driven by layered synthesizers and lush drums that juxtapose the track’s powerful flow. Inspired by the endless protesting across the country, the track is saturated with heavy lyrics detailing an ‘eye for an eye’ battle against America’s unjust police system, with uprising chants for lines such as: “For every tax I pay to let them kill, I take a life / In my utopia, equivalent exchange is peace of mind”. Duster Lizzie (the moniker of East Los Angeles’s own Eddie Hernandez) says about the track: “Utopia is not a permanent concept to me, it’s an impossible goal to reach, but in this case, I see it as a brief marker of relief. When Trump lost the election, there should have only been a split-second celebration over what really is a victory so small in volume, before continuing to work against social injustice. Everyone who still thinks the battle has been won is living in a privileged bubble. The world is fucked, police abolition is key.”

    </div>

    The accompanying video is self-directed by Hernandez himself and is a deep-fried karaoke-like visualizer with lyrics speeding over the screen in massive bold type similar to a lightspeed bombardment of pop-up advertisements. “There’s no other way I wanted the video for this track to turn out. I just wanted to dance around in this remote location I’ve been quarantined at for several months whilst singing such politically charged lyrics. In the last few months, it’s been so special for me to participate in protests and see fellow protesters dance along to music on the scene, whether folks are blasting music from their speakers, or someone’s got a tambourine. They continue to dance and move and embrace their bodies, despite the weight that the world forces them to carry. That’s the energy I wanted to capture in this video. With lyrics as bold as those in ‘In My Utopia,’ it made sense to have them fly out at the screen and visually attack the viewer. It’s supposed to confront you; it’s supposed to make you snap out of it every morning and question to yourself, “what efforts have I made today to fight against those who keep getting away with killing innocent people?”

    JONATHAN F. RELEASES NEW EP “BAPTISM OF FIRE”
  </h1>

  </a>

  </br>
  </br>

  Today, Jonathan F. is thrilled to be sending his brand new EP, ‘Baptism of Fire’, out to music publications and blogs for consideration and review. The EP
  is designed to play as a mix all the way through, with no dull moment in between. Heavily inspired by The Avalanches, Madlib, 90's hip-hop and psychedelic music from the 60's & 70's,
  'Baptism of Fire' plays with plunderphonics and hip-hop in order to create one grand sonic experience. Each song naturally flows into one another, breaking every few minutes of the EP into movements rather
  than as separate tracks. 'Baptism of Fire' is an homage to growing up in East LA in the 90's, watching vintage Reality Dating television shows, as well as campy horror movies.

  </br>
  </br>

  For the past year and a half, Jonathan F. has rerouted his energy from heartbreak and existential dread to a newfound love
  for both romance and music. Stuck in his bedroom with little direction or inspiration to create new music, Jonathan became infatuated with the Avalanches
  and 90’s/00’s hip-hop producers and their tendency to haul tons of used records as a way to collect samples for their own music. Quickly, he transitioned from seeing
  zero sunlight to being at the record store for hours taking after his idols. At home, Jonathan would revert to his Roland SP-404 and manipulate tiny bits of loops from this vinyl collection
  he’d amassed and in turn, churned out ‘Baptism of Fire’.

  Jonathan F. is the alias of East Los Angeles-based Mexican-American artist Jonathan Rocha. Previously, Jonathan F., Rocha
  self-released music as
  <a href="https://soundcloud.com/mezclillaazul" class="intext">

  and composed the score for the 2019 indie film
  <a href="https://vimeo.com/343975585" class="intext">
  “Midnight Run” </a>
  in 2019.
