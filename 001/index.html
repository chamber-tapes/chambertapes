chamber tapes is a record label rooted in east los angeles, california. although
established officially in 2021, founders eddie hernandez, jonathan rocha, and
their collective of friends have been making art in various forms for about a
decade and counting. chamber tapes exists to pinpoint a community of underrepresented
artists in one tiny pixel of the world and spread its effervescent light across the globe.
</br>
</br>
we believe nothing is more important in a label than to build a family, not an empire.
growing up and starting off our music careers in an area as dominantly latinx as
east la, we had nothing but ourselves to call home. other musicians in our area
around us were grinding with their ska/punk bands, alt/indie, but nothing really
spoke to us like the music we enjoy producing. the more we became overwhelmed with
labels being overrun by predominantly white people, consistently looking for a
specific profiiable “sound” or “image”, the more organic it felt to make a label
where we find the genuine in primarily BIPOC+/LGBTQ+ artists like us that have
the ability to make whatever the absolute hell they want to make.
</br>
</br>
although our personal projects ranges from producing bedroom pop to electronic,
hip-hop, and plunderphonics, if it’s interesting, fresh, and fruitful, and if
you’re a decent enough human being, you might likely belong here. we are still
in the midst of setting up shop, so for now, we are currently not accepting demos,
but soon, stay tuned!
